## Pathlib-Tkinter
A simple file manager application using tkinter and pathlib.
Tkinter is used to generate the application's front-end look which is easy to customize and intergrate with a module like pathlib. Since pathlib deals with directories arrays and lists come in handy during extracting paths.
